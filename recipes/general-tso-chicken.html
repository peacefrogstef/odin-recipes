        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>General Tso’s chicken is one of my all time favorite Chinese food dishes. I love that it’s crispy, with a hint of sweet and a hint of spicy. I’ve started making this recipe at home when we’re craving Asian food, but don’t want to take the time to go to a restaurant. It’s been a huge hit, both with the kids and the adults!
        <br>

        This is one of my favorite Chinese entrees. When I want to make a Chinese food feast, I like to pair this chicken with some of my favorite appetizers like hot and sour soup, egg drop soup and cream cheese wontons. You also could serve this chicken with a flavorful side dish like beef lo mein or beef fried rice. Mix and match your own ultimate Chinese dinner!
