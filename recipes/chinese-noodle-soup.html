        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 pounds chicken leg quarters (about 2 leg quarters)f</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>5 cups water</li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh thin wheat noodles (of your choice; or 3.5 ounces/100g dried noodles)</li>
            <li>2-3 slices ginger (about ⅛-inch/0.3cm thick, 2 inches/5cm long)</li>
            <li>1 large handful leafy greens</li>
            <li>White pepper powder (to taste)</li>
            <li>▢chili oil (to garnish, optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly preheat a Dutch Oven or thick-bottomed soup pot over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, add the oil, and then add the chicken leg quarters skin-side down. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until lightly browned, and then flip and cook on the other side for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Shaoxing wine, water, ginger slices, and whole scallion (you can cut it in half crosswise to fit into the pot). Cover and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Bring a separate pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Remove the chicken leg quarters from the soup pot, and let cool for a few minutes. Add salt and white pepper powder to the soup to taste</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to package instructions. In the last 30 seconds to 1 minute of cooking, add the leafy greens, and cook along with the noodles.</li>
        <li>Divide the noodles and greens among 2-3 bowls, and ladle the soup broth on top. Top with the shredded chicken and chili oil (if desired). Serve! </li>
        </ol>
